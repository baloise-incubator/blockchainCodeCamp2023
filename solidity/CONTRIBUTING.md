We are using Online RemixIDE. There is possibility to connect it with local
file space where you can open in your favourite ide and write Solidty code with
help of https://www.npmjs.com/package/@remix-project/remixd which will open
a socket from your local file system to the ide.

After writing contract, one needs to compile it and then click on deploy
in RemixIDE.
